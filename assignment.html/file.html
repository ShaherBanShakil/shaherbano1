     <p> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos
         Aveiro most popularly known as Cristiano Ronaldo.
          He was born on 5 February 1985. He is popularly known 
          for his amazing life story as a footballer. He has inspired
           the world with his skills. In honour of his father’s favourite 
           movie actor, Ronald Reagan,  Chritiano Ronaldo got his name. He has 
           five very well bred children. If one comes across anyone that Christiano 
           Ronaldo has worked with or even based on interviews, it is clear 
           that this man has an insane work ethic. He is driven by hard work; one of
            his famous quotes lies within these words. “.Talent without working
             hard is nothing. I see myself as the best footballer in the world.
              If you don’t believe you are the best, then you will never achieve all 
              that you are capable of.” As we take a look at his past. We see that he
               was a troubled boy. He had not much to live with. His family was also
                seen to suffer financially before he gained his fame as a footballer.
                 He went to the extent of cleaning the streets and the family grew relative
                  to poverty. One of the biggest regrets that Christians had to
         live with is that his father never got to see the fame of his son</p>
